# Hi, I'm Deva Priya Mankena  
**Engineer | Researcher | Architect of Intelligent Systems**

Welcome to my GitHub — a curated showcase of my journey through the evolving world of Artificial Intelligence, where curiosity meets engineering, and research meets real-world impact.

I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science at Michigan Technological University (April 2025), and I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in Machine Learning, AI Engineering, or LLM-powered product development.

My journey into AI began not just with code, but with questions: How do machines understand language? How can learning systems adapt across domains? These questions led me from classical ML models to deep learning, and eventually to large language models, agentic workflows, and real-time intelligent applications.

Over the last few years, I’ve worked on a broad range of projects — from simulating optical interference patterns for scientific sensing, to fine-tuning LLMs, building agent-powered feedback analyzers, and deploying multilingual document interpreters. I specialize in creating AI solutions that are scalable, explainable, and impactful.

Whether through academic research or production-ready prototypes, I’m driven by one goal: to turn cutting-edge models into meaningful tools that solve real-world problems. If you’re looking for someone who blends research depth with practical execution — let’s connect.

## My Focus  
As a Data Science graduate student and AWS-certified Machine Learning Specialist, I bring a research-driven yet application-focused mindset to building intelligent systems. I work at the intersection of deep learning, natural language processing, and generative AI — turning complex models into practical, usable tools that serve users and industries alike.

From simulating petal interference patterns using orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams to deploying multi-agent LLM-based chat systems, I’ve built a portfolio that reflects **scientific rigor, engineering depth, and user-centric thinking**.
