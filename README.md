## 💼 Project Experience
### **Retrieval Augmented Generation**
- Utilized the **Gemma 2B model** and **FAISS** for storing vector representations of data.
- Implemented vector embeddings to retrieve and generate answers based on relevant questions.
- Key contributions included data ingestion, transformation, and integration with FAISS for efficient retrieval and accurate responses.

### **Next Word Prediction**
- Developed an LSTM-based model to predict the next word in a sentence.
- Trained on a large text corpus to capture long-term dependencies and learn context effectively.
- Suggested the most likely next word based on the learned context.

### **Language Translation**
- Used the **Llama 3 model** and implemented **Langchain** for effective querying and seamless communication.
- Streamlined communication using `langchain_core.message` and ensured clear, structured output with `langchain_core.output_parser`.
- Improved user experience through efficient translation processes.

### **Text Summarization**
- Leveraged the **Gemma model** for summarizing text efficiently.
- Fine-tuned the model on a large corpus to identify key sentences and generate concise summaries.
- Utilized a transformer-based architecture to produce accurate, human-like summaries with high relevance.
