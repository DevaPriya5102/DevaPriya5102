# Hi, I'm Deva Priya Mankena  
**Engineer | AI Researcher | Builder of Intelligent Systems**

Welcome to my GitHub — where science meets real-world AI.  
I specialize in developing scalable machine learning solutions, fine-tuning LLMs, and designing agentic workflows to solve meaningful problems across domains.

---

## My Focus  
As a Data Science graduate student and AWS-certified Machine Learning Specialist, I bring a research-driven yet application-focused mindset to building intelligent systems. I work at the intersection of deep learning, natural language processing, and generative AI — turning complex models into practical, usable tools that serve users and industries alike.

From simulating petal interference patterns using orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams to deploying multi-agent LLM-based chat systems, I’ve built a portfolio that reflects **scientific rigor, engineering depth, and user-centric thinking**.

## What I Excel At  

**LLMs and GenAI Applications**  
- Fine-tuning and deploying models like GPT, LLaMA, Claude, DeepSeek using QLoRA and instruction tuning  
- Building RAG pipelines with FAISS/Chroma and LangChain to enable context-aware information retrieval  

**Agentic AI Systems**  
- Designing autonomous workflows using CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph to coordinate intelligent task execution  

**Scientific Modeling & Simulation**  
- Conducting AI-driven optical simulations (OAM beams & petal generation) to support research in sensing technologies  

**ML Engineering & MLOps**  
- Data wrangling, supervised learning, model evaluation, and deployment on AWS/GCP using Docker and Streamlit  

**Natural Language Processing**  
- Building NLP pipelines for classification, summarization, translation, and NLU across multilingual datasets
